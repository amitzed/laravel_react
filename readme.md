#### Technologies Used:
##### REACT JS
##### Laravel PHP
##### Heroku

#### This WiP (Work in Progress) was created to try to use React JS with Laravel as opposed to Vue JS, which is the front-end that Laravel is typically used with.  While the front-end is being written with React, the RESTful backend still has yet to have an update and delete route for items.
